# 3D Object Tracking

Pre-requirements:
- keypoint detectors;
- descriptors;
- methods to match them between successive images;
- how to detect objects in an image using the YOLO deep-learning framework;
- how to associate regions in a camera image with Lidar points in 3D space.

Program schematic to see what have accomplished and what's still missing:

In this project, all the missing parts in the schematic to be implement.
To do this, four major tasks need to be completed: 
1. First, develop a way to match 3D objects over time by using keypoint correspondences. 
2. Second, compute the TTC based on Lidar measurements. 
3. Proceed to do the same using the camera, which requires to first associate keypoint matches to regions of interest and then to compute the TTC based on those matches. 
4. And lastly, conduct various tests with the framework. The goal is to identify the most suitable detector/descriptor combination for TTC estimation and also to search for problems that can lead to faulty measurements by the camera or Lidar sensor.

NOTE: Kalman filter is a great way to combine the two independent TTC measurements into an improved version which is much more reliable than a single sensor alone can be.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 2.8
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* Git LFS
  * Weight files are handled using [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
* OpenCV >= 4.1
  * This must be compiled from source using the `-D OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON` cmake flag for testing the SIFT and SURF detectors.
  * The OpenCV 4.1.0 source code can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.0)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
